# Under-water-survilleance-drone
ROV Underwater Surveillance Drone is my final year diploma project, designed to explore and monitor underwater environments using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The system is built on an Arduino microcontroller platform and controlled wirelessly using the FlySky CT6B transmitter and receiver. It features four DC motors — two for vertical movement (up/down) and two for horizontal movement (left/right) — all driven using relay-based control.

A waterproof Wi-Fi camera is mounted on the drone to provide live underwater video footage for surveillance, research, or inspection purposes. The entire setup is powered by a 12V LiPo battery and housed in a waterproof PVC frame, making it compact, portable, and cost-effective for small-scale aquatic robotics.
